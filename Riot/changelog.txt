RIOT changelog

Legend:

* : fixed
! : changed
+ : added
- : removed

v. 0.5.2
* fixed r s h l v keys prohibited in batch->output path
* fixed filesize different single file vs batch mode if image is resized and using automatic mode.The original was analyzed instead of the resized one in batch mode.
* fixed RIOT stops opening images after switching to batch mode and back
* fixed scrollbar flicker
* fixed loading of TGA 8-bit files with a palette size greater that 256
* fixed TIFF parser didn't initialize the memory with zeros in stripped mode. This caused random bitmap data if the tiff file was corrupted/invalid.

v. 0.5.1 (22.08.2013)
* fixed opening of images with a single color like the one found in jquery-UI (ui-icons_2e83ff_256x240)
* fixed Compress to size action enabling
* fixed a bug in batch mode when using manual format
! using checkerboard to show transparency instead of background color from file. Some images have the background the same color as the foreground and that can be confusing.

v. 0.5.0 (17.07.2013)
+ added automatic optimization mode
+ added loading support for "half float" format to TIFF
+ added drag folder to load files in batch mode
+ added progress monitoring for jpeg load/save and resize
! superior internal PNG compression. Added 4 compression levels (zlib-9 with heuristics and filters for low setting and zopfli deflate used for the higher settings)
! color quantization to 2 colors now outputs  1 bit images instead of 4 bit (smaller filesize)
! changed transparency settings (added simplify checkbox)
! faster color quantization of images with 16 colors or less (output bit depth controlled by the quantizer itself)
! greatly improved resize/resampling speed
! upgraded to LibTiff 4.0.3
! upgraded to libPNG 1.5.13
! upgraded to OpenJPEG 1.5.1
! allowed loading of PNG with benign errors (such as images with too many IDATs)
* batch settings: keep date date & report size changes options are now preserved
* fixed crashing when loading some JPEG files with invalid EXIF tag length
* fixed PNG plugin with saving of transparent monochrome images
* fixed JPEG error: Exif: Suspicious offset of first IFD value
* fixed a crash when loading TIFF images with a TIFFTAG_TRANSFERFUNCTION Exif tag
* fixed a crash reading a TIFF with an uncommon 24-bit palettized file
* allowed loading of TIF with missing bitspersample/samplesperpixel/photometric tags
* fixed BigTIFF signature validation
* fixed TIFF plugin truncating metadata tag on loading if type is ASCII and it's value is of variable size (TIFF_VARIABLE)
* fixed loading of Exif with bad thumbnail data or with a bad first offset size
* fixed PSD parser when reading PSD files with corrupted resources
* resize: fixed a NULL-pointer access bug occurring for transparent images with a linear palette
- removed PNG interlacing
- removed Grayscale from Color reduction presets => replaced with Grayscale checkbox in Image adjustments
- removed libMNG, using internal reader instead

v.0.4.6 (25.02.2011)
+ added Help file (not yet complete)
+ DLL version: added flags for all JPEG chroma settings
* DLL version: the default chroma for RIOT_SaveToFile is now "medium" instead of "low"
* Batch mode: fixed a bug when using a bat file as external PNG optimizer and @echo off is not on the first line.
  This problem does not occur in normal mode.
* DLL version: fixed some sliders going nuts when pressed during tooltip display
* fixed preview executed twice when asked to resample big images
* Batch settings "Keep original date/time" and "Report file size changes" are now remembered at startup
* if "Report file size changes" is checked and the selected external optimizer is not installed the reported size
  is -100% or ~ -99.9%. Fixed !
* fixed error running same batch twice with external optimizer and "Keep original date/time is checked
* file is now set as modified only if OptimizePNG is successfully executed
* fixed related issues reported in the RIOT forum, with the external PNG optimizer implementation
* fixed a memory leak in FileIsWritetable
! avoid some file locking problems

v.0.4.5 (12.01.2011)
* fixed a bug with Paste from clipboard. Pasted images were shifted a few pixels.
* fixed a bug in the DLL version with the toolbar containing rotate, resize, compress to size, etc.
  The toolbar should be enabled after successful image loading from the host application.


v.0.4.4 (19.10.2010)
! the Batch window is not displayed anymore if the images sent as parameters are not supported. The previous behavior was to show the window with no files loaded.
* fixed an access violation at startup in the DLL version, which occurs only in Vista (possible Windows 7).
  The exception is caught when reading the configuration data.
- removed optipng -o5 external PNG optimizer preset and added advpng preset by default

v.0.4.3 (16.10.2010)
! optimized startup sequence
! updated FastMM to version 4.97
! updated vclfixpack to version 1.4 (some fixed which are not needed were removed)
* fixed Vista (possible Windows 7) bug with not being able to type in the batch dialog some characters used as shortcuts (R, L, etc).
  This occurs only if the program is launched with at least 2 files as parameters which results in the Batch window being opened at startup.
* corrected a name in the About->Credits section
* fixed some memory leaks in the batch dialog related to the FileList
* fixed a crash in FreeImage when reading a JPEG with corrupted XMP data
* fixed loading of JPEG images with a not null but zero length IPTC segment (bad files produced by Picasa)

v.0.3.5 - 27 oct. 2009
- bugfix: Save image fails in some cases. It occurs only when the image is opened by command line or drag & drop and "Show dialog on Save"
is disabled (default) - the original image is not updated (overwritten).
The image is saved in fact in the wrong folder (current folder). Fixed !
- fixed handling of PSD files with a non zero file header reserved member
- fixed TIF module crashing on a malformed TIFF-JPEG compressed image
- fixed MNG module crashing on some old mng images
- metadata: added new 'non standard' Exif tags (HostComputer, Rating, RatingPercent) -  These tags are not part of the Exiv v2.2
specifications but are often loaded by applications as Exif data
- added loading of Exif orientation tag in TIFF module
- other minor fixes

v.0.3.4 - 10 oct. 2009
- DLL version: fixed comdlg32 access violation when using the save button in Vista 32bit SP2 (not tested on Vista 64).
- new fullscreen view
-added support for all Photoshop supported color modes to PSD loading (with the exception of 32-bit float RGB)
- improved speed for jpeg encoding & decoding by 17% (using SIMD optimized code)
- improved speed of zlib compression (used for PNG) by 30% (using ASM optimized code)
- Bugfix: Riot.ini is in the Riot folder with write permissions, but Riot
creates and uses Application Data folder. Fixed !
- The Save button is now context sensitive - meaning it is automatically disabled and enabled when needed (ex: disabled after
Save to see the operation completed succesfully, disabled if the autoamtic preview is not active, etc)
- added option to show the "Save As" Dialog on the "Save" action. Default false, requests only replace confirmation if file exists or
shows the dialog if the file does not exist.
- the last used save folder is now stored and used each time the user presses "Save as"
- DLL version: the image resolution (dpi) is now imported directly from the DIB. Benefit: When used as irfanView plugin RIOT can keep now
the resolution without the need to activate import ancillary info.
- improved exception handling when saving a file
- flicker reduced or eliminated on most controls
- fixed some minor issues and potential access violations
- updated libraries libtiff (3.9.1), libpng (1.2.40), FreeImage (3.13.0 and from official CVS)
- moved shortcuts from menu to global actions to make them usable in fullscreen
- added new hidden configuration variable for use within Riot.ini: UseLatestCommonDialogs (0 disabled [default], 1 enabled).
When enabled Riot shows the new Vista dialogs. When disabled the old XP style dialogs are shown in Vista.
Note that the IrfanView plugin gives access violations when using the new dialogs.
- DLL version: fixed black background for icons in some rare cases (no manifest in calling app)
- other minor improvements

v.0.3.3 - 13 may 2009
- plugins: fixed some memory leaks (especially noticeable in batch operations with RIOT_SaveToFile/RIOT_SaveToFile_U).
Set file size function from IrfanView was affected by this problem.
- in the previous version of FreeImage bundled with RIOT v0.3.2 the support for different TIFF compression types was ommited. Now fixed.
- fixed some invalid pointer operations
- faster startup; ini file is read at once and stored/updated in memory
- speed optimizations for preview; fixed some bugs with automatic preview invoked more than once in some cases
- bugfix: rotating 4bit images now works
- cbanged the general font to an antialiased one (Trebuchet MS)
- minor corrections for display on 120 dpi font setting
- The ini file was not read at startup in some functions and that made the program ask for resample each time.
Function affected from the plugin version were: RIOT_LoadFromFile/RIOT_LoadFromHBITMAP.
In the standalone version opening images using the command line or dropping files onto the program icon in explorer. 
- bugfix: File->Exit or pressing Esc terminates the application but does not save settings. Fixed !
- bugfix: after modifying Show Captions for main toolbar buttons the image is now centered.
- plugins: if file sent as parameter does not exist or left blank Original File Info is not updated (occurs in rare situations)

v.0.3.2
- plugin: fixed a problem in 0.3.1 with the IrfanView plugin when retrieving configuration settings. An access violation error was thrown.
- configuration data is now stored in the current user's Application Data folder.
If Riot.ini is found in the Riot folder, it is used only if the current user has write permissions for it.
(this makes it compatible with putting Rot in Program Files for Vista)
 
v.0.3.1
- 4bpp output now supported (automatically chosen when quantizating to less than 16 colors)
- keep transparency for 1 and 4 bit PNG
- added Save button for quick saving over the original. Save as is still there for choosing another folder
- plugins: RIOT_SaveToFile (function used by IrfanView "Set file size") can keep now metadata (exif, iptc, comments, etc).
To operate in IrfanView it needs a new version of IrfanView (next after 4.23)
- upgraded libpng to 1.2.35
- some optimizations in FreeImage (from the official CVS)
- plugins only: fixed some object destruction bugs causing unexpected behaviour (usually access violations).
This bug especially affects Compress to size.
- plugins: improvements in file info display from the title bar
(don't display size twice when DIB size equals original image size from file).
- plugins: for unsupported images file info was not updated. In this situation it shows BMP as format

v.0.3.0 (beta) 
- new/usability: interesting interface changes including new layout, new icons 
- new/usability: automatically store last used settings on exit in ini file 
- new/usability: check for updates automatically every month on program startup or manually 
- new/usability: in place compare (allows to display the original image over the optimized image to see small pixel changes as long
as you keep this button pressed) 
- improvement/usability: The metadata options are moved from the format specific options to a separate tab now 
- improvement/usability: separate tab for the new transparency options (keep, blend/composite, set opaque).
The program now properly handles alpha transparency composition to 24bit 
- new/usability: options dialog 
- plugins: allows user to import ancillary data (transparency, background color, metadata, ICC profile, image resolution)
from original filename when the image is sent as DIB. The ability to import transparency from original file is offered for
IrfanView which does not send 32bit DIBs. Transparency is imported only when DIB and original file have the same size. 
- new/usability: auto-rotate images according to EXIF info 
- new/usability: option to show/hide button captions from the main toolbar 
- new/usability: the user can choose the zoom step percent 
- new/usability: scrollbars now make use of the larger step when clicking on the empty space between the arrow buttons and she sliding box 
- improvement: preserve transparency (GIF only) when using Dither for 1bit images based on higher bpp transparent images.
(even if transparency is not shown yet for this kind of image) 
- plugins: when ancillary data imported, the window title offers more detailed info about the source image. 
- improvement: added additional file types for loading (DirectDraw Surface (*.dds)|*.dds|Dr. Halo (*.cut)|*.cut|
Raw Fax format CCITT G3(*.g3)|*.g3|Amiga IFF (*.iff, *.lbm)|*.iff;*.lbm|Commodore 64 Koala format (*.koa)|*.koa|
Portable Graymap (*.pgm)|*.pgm) 
- improvement/usability: added missing text hints 
- improvement/usability: added warning when an incompatible FreeImage library is used 
- usability: automatic preview checkbox moved into the view menu

-plugins: RIOT_saveToFile (compress to size) speed improved

v.0.1.12
-bugfix: ICC profile is lost after Rotate. Fixed.

v.0.1.11 (stable candidate #8)
- bugfix: plugin - IrfanView sends a filename even if file does not exist (like Clipboard01).
This resulted in an "Error opening file".
Added FileExists check into RIOT to overcome this problem. Fixed !
- bugfix: Paste from clipboard and plugin function LoadFromHBITMAP gives "Error opening file" because no format was set. Fixed !

v.0.1.10 (stable candidate #7)
-improvement/bugfix: Transparency is now fully kept regardlessof bit depth.
Color quantization now does not lose transparency. Alpha transparency can be converted to indexed transparency.
-improvement: drastically decreased memory usage especially for RIOT Full:
	* DIB size + compressed image size in idle if DIBs fit in the video card memory, more otherwise
	* up to 3xDIB size when processing
	(Note that OpenPictureDialog preview does not free his image in memory until another preview is made.
With open by drag & drop no image preview is stored in memory)
- added RGBF image support for TIFF
- added Vista icons support (very few viewers can open them now !)
- added IPTC support for RIOT Lite
